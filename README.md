# Excel Comparator

Quick project to learn rust. 
Considering you have an Excel with two columns one with english text each line and the other with french text and you want to know which lines have the same meaning or not ( even though there are not translated as the same ).
Uses Hexagonal architecture and Mistral API.

Could be improved a lot by batching the request to the API but it's not so much the point.
